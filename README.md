# Export File System

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.8. This application allows user to export the selected files.
- Re-usable components such as Export and Dashboard. The Export alert popup is a highly generic component that can be used as-is.
- SCSS variables are used for easier maintenance and reusability.
- Unit test cases with 100% coverage.
- Utilizing angular directive for more efficient and optimized code.
- Added disclaimer - only available files can be downloaded
